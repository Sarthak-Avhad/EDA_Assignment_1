Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 used cars to explore the factors that influence car prices. The dataset includes car attributes such as brand, model, manufacturing year, engine size, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and ownership history.

The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derive meaningful insights about the automobile resale market. The project can also be extended into a machine learning model for predicting car prices based on key features.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 10 columns and 10,000 rows.

Column Description Brand Car brand (e.g., Kia, Audi, Mercedes) Model Model name of the car Year Manufacturing year Engine_Size Engine size (in liters) Fuel_Type Type of fuel (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric) Transmission Gear type (Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic) Mileage Total distance driven (in km) Doors Number of doors Owner_Count Number of previous owners Price Car resale price (target variable) 🎯 Objectives

Understand pricing patterns in the used car market.

Explore relationships between price and other attributes (year, mileage, brand, etc.).

Identify the most important features affecting resale price.
